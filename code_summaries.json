    "Customer": "Here is a class summary for the `Customer` class:\n\n**Class Name:** Customer\n\n**Purpose:** The `Customer` class represents a customer entity in a system. It encapsulates the customer's identification, name, and email information.\n\n**Attributes:**\n\n* `id`: a unique identifier for the customer (int)\n* `name`: the customer's name (String)\n* `email`: the customer's email address (String)\n\n**Methods:**\n\n* `getId()`: returns the customer's ID\n* `setId(int)`: sets the customer's ID\n* `getName()`: returns the customer's name\n* `setName(String)`: sets the customer's name\n* `getEmail()`: returns the customer's email\n* `setEmail(String)`: sets the customer's email\n* `toString()`: returns a string representation of the customer, including their ID, name, and email\n\n**Use Case Requirements:**\n\nThis class can be used in a system that requires managing customer information, such as an e-commerce platform, a customer relationship management (CRM) system, or a simple customer database application. The class provides getters and setters for each attribute, allowing the customer's information to be retrieved and updated. The `toString()` method can be used to display customer information in a human-readable format.",
    "CustomerRepository": "Here is a summary of the CustomerRepository class:\n\n**Class Purpose:**\nThe CustomerRepository class is a data storage and retrieval mechanism for customers. It provides methods for saving, retrieving, and deleting customer data.\n\n**Attributes:**\n\n* customerMap: A HashMap that maps customer IDs to Customer objects.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n* save(Customer customer): Saves a customer object to the customerMap using the customer's ID.\n* findById(int id): Retrieves a Customer object from the customerMap using the given ID.\n* deleteById(int id): Deletes a Customer object from the customerMap using the given ID.\n\n**Use Case Requirements Mapping:**\nThis class can be used in scenarios where:\n\n1. A application needs to store and retrieve customer data, such as a customer management system.\n2. A application needs to maintain a cache of customer data, such as a web application with frequent customer lookups.\n3. A application requires fast lookup and deletion of customer data, such as a transactional system that needs to quickly retrieve or cancel customer orders.\n\nIn summary, the CustomerRepository class is a simple, in-memory data store for customer data that provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.",
    "CustomerService": "Here is a class summary for the provided Java class:\n\n**Class Name:** CustomerService\n\n**Purpose:** To provide a service layer for customer-related operations.\n\n**Attributes:** \n\n* `repository`: An instance of the CustomerRepository interface used to interact with a database or a storage system.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n* `getCustomerById(int id)`: Retrieves a customer from the database by their unique ID.\n* `addCustomer(Customer customer)`: Creates a new customer in the database.\n* `deleteCustomer(int id)`: Deletes a customer from the database by their unique ID.\n\nThis class acts as an interface between the business logic and the data storage layer, allowing for the abstraction of the underlying storage system._CLIENTS-can use this class to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on customer data by creating an instance of the CustomerService class and calling its methods.\n\nUse case requirements that this class can map to include:\n\n1. Creating a customer data storage system where the data can be accessed and manipulated using a service layer.\n2. Implementing a customer management system where data can be retrieved, created, and deleted using a service-based architecture.\n3. Providing a layer of abstraction between the business logic and the data storage layer for a customer-facing application.",
    "Main": "Here is a summary of the Main class that can be used to map the code to a use case requirement:\n\n**Class Summary:** Main is the entry point of the application responsible for testing the use of CustomerService, CustomerRepository, and Customer classes.\n\n**Attributes:** None\n\n**Methods:**\n\n1. **main(String[] args):** This is the primary method that starts the application execution. It creates instances of CustomerRepository, CustomerService, and uses them to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on customers. Specifically:\n    - Adds two customers to the repository.\n    - Retrieves a customer by ID.\n    - Deletes a customer by ID.\n\nThis summary can be used to map the Main class to a use case requirement where the requirement involves creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting customer records with unique IDs and email addresses.\n\nNote: The actual implementation of CustomerRepository, CustomerService, and Customer classes are left out in this summary."
