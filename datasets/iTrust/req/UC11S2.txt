HCPs can return to an office visit and modify or delete the fields of the office visit [date, hospital, notes, prescriptions, laboratory procedures (UC26), referral (UC33), diagnoses, procedures, and/or immunizations]. The event is logged (UC 5, S8) and the HCP is returned in the specific office visit record to verify his or her changes.
