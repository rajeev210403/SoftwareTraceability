The expired prescription report list is titled with the patient name. The expired prescription list includes medication, date prescribed (i.e., the day of the office visit), start date, end date for each prescription, and the name of the LHCP who prescribed the medication (where the name of the LHCP is linked to contact information for that LHCP). If there are no expired prescriptions, an empty expired prescription list is presented.
