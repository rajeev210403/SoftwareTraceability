A patient or personal health representative may enter or edit their own demographic information including their security question/answer according to data format 6.1. When answer to the security question is typed in, the answer should not appear on the screen (similar to how a password normally appears) and the answer should be confirmed (by the patient or personal health representative) before it is saved.
