An HCP chooses to view received referrals. The receiving HCP is presented with a list of referrals sorted by priority (from most important to least important). The receiving HCP then selects a referral to view details and is presented with the name and specialty of the sending HCP, the patient's name, the referral notes, the referral priority, the office visit date with a link to the office visit, and the time the referral was created.
