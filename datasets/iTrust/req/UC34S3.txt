An LHCP chooses to view the physiologic data monitoring details. The LHCP is presented with a listing of all his or her patients whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring with their blood pressure and glucose levels, recording timestamp, and whom reported the data (patient, UAP name, personal representative name). Patients with no information for the current day are highlighted. Patients with blood pressure or glucose level out of range are highlighted (normal blood pressure: systolic 90-140; diastolic 60-90; normal glucose 70-150). The LHCP can select a patient to obtain additional information about a patient [S4].
