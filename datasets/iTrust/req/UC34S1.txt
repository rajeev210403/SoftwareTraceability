An LHCP or UAP can add and delete patients from his or her monitoring list. A patient is added to the list by the LHCP or UAP typing in the patient's MID [E1] or name. An LHCP can delete a patient from his or her monitoring list by the LHCP typing the the patient's MID [E1]. In both cases, the LHCP is presented the name of the patient and must confirm the add/delete. For each patient from the monitoring list, the LHCP can choose to edit which types of remote monitoring information (blood pressure, glucose levels, height, weight, and pedometer readings) should be submitted by the patient. By default, all types of information are selected for monitoring.
