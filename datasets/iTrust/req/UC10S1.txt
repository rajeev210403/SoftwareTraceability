The health care personnel enters a MID [E1] of a patient and confirms their selection [E2]. The health care personnel may enter/edit personal health information including editing historical values from Data Format 6.4.1, 6.4.2, 6.4.3, and 6.4.4, immunizations, and office visit information (date, diagnoses, medication, name of attending physician but not notes, laboratory procedures), family history (the MIDs of the patient's mother and father), and Body Mass Index (BMI) [S3]. The HCP can indicate the patient has passed away, providing an appropriate diagnosis code. The HCP can graph height or weight of the patient over the last 3 calendar years [S3].
