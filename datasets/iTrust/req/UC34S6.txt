A patient can select to report physiologic measurements for those whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring andfor whom he/she is a patient representative. He/she is presented with a list of the patients whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring and for which he/she is allowed to report measurements. He or she can select a patient and then enter data. He or she can report the blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) [E2] and/or glucose levels [E3] for the patient. The input data and a timestamp and the fact that the status was reported by patient representative and their MID are saved. Only the applicable input entries (those whose corresponding data types of the patient are specified to be under monitoring) are displayed to the patient.
