The patient or personal health representative can see patient personal health information (including historical values), immunizations, and office visit information (date, diagnoses, medication, name of attending physician but not notes, laboratory procedures) for (a) their own records and (b) the records for whom the user is a personal representative. If a patient or personal health representative has not taken an office visit satisfaction survey for an office visit yet, the patient may choose to take the survey for an office visit (if the survey has already been taken, the patient or personal health representative will not have the ability to take the survey or view their previously submitted survey)
