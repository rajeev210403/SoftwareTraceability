An HCP can create a lab procedure for a given office visit. The HCP selects a procedure code, a priority from 1 to 3 (1=most important, 3=not as important), and Lab Technician (listed with his/her specialty and the number of pending lab procedures in his/her priority queue, grouped by priority). The HCP saves the new lab procedure, or cancels the lab procedure creation [E1], [E2]. The status of the lab procedure is marked as in transit.
