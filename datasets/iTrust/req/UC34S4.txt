An LHCP selects to view additional information for a patient. The LHCP is presented with a screen upon which he/she can choose a date range. Once the date range is selected, the LHCP can see the patient name; patient phone number; personal representative (name and phone number), if applicable; and the blood pressure, glucose levels, height, weight, and pedometer readings as well as whom reported the data (patient, UAP name, personal representative name) for that date range.
