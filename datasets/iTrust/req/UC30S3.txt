A patient or patient representative wishes to reply to a message. The patient/representative views his or her message inbox. The patient/representative opens the message to which he or she wishes to reply [S5], and then clicks the reply link above the message text. The patient/representative enters the text of the response message (up to 1000 characters) he or she wishes to send, then clicks the send button. A row for showing the message subject (now preceded by RE:), the name of the recipient, and the timestamp is then visible in the patient/representative's message outbox. A bolded row for showing the message subject (now preceded by RE:), the name of the sender, and timestamp is then visible in the LHCP's message inbox. A fake email is sent to the LHCP alerting the LHCP that a new message reply has arrived.
