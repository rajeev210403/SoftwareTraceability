The HCP enters a MID [E1] or name of a patient and confirms their selection [E2]. The HCP documents the office visit date; hospital location of the office visit, if any, (the default should be the HCP's home location); and notes (numbers, characters, #, ;, ?, -, ', ., :, blankspace and carriage return are all allowed input values) about an office visit. The HCP's medical identification number should also be maintained. Additionally, the HCP can document none, one, or more medications (NDC, see Data Format 6.6) prescribed [S3]; none, one, or more lab procedures that are ordered (LOINC code, see Data Format 6.11)(UC26); none, one, or more diagnoses (via the ICD-9CM code); none, one, or more medical procedures (CPT code) performed; and none, one, or more immunizations given (CPT Code, see UC15, S1) chosen from appropriate pull-down lists. The HCP may also add a patient referral (UC33). All events are logged (UC5, S8).
