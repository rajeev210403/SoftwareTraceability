 A patient or personal representative for a patient chooses to send a message to an LHCP (no multiple recipients allowed in a single message). The patient/representative is presented with a pull down menu of his/her DLHCP. The patient/representative chooses one of these DLHCP and types the subject (up to 100 characters) and text of a message (up to 1000 characters), and clicks the send button. A row for showing the message subject, the name of the recipient, and the timestamp (which includes both date and time) is then visible in the patient/representative's message outbox. A bolded row for showing the message subject, the name of sender, and the timestamp is then visible in the LHCP's message inbox. A fake email is sent to the LHCP alerting the user that a new message has arrived. After a message is sent, the patient or personal representative is directed to his/her message outbox.
