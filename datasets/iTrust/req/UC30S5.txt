A user (a patient, patient representative, or LHCP) wishes to read a message from the message inbox or outbox. The user chooses to open his or her message inbox/outbox. Each row in the message inbox/outbox includes the message subject, the name of either the sender (only for the case of inbox) or recipient (only for the case of outbox), and timestamp. By default, the messages in the message inbox/outbox should be ordered by timestamp, the most recent first. Each row for an unread message in the message inbox is bolded. The user selects a message from the message inbox/outbox to read by clicking the Read link beside the row for the message, and then the message subject, the name of the sender, the name of the the recipient, timestamp, and the message text shall be displayed in a new page. After a message in the message inbox is read (i.e., displayed in a new page), the row for the message in the message inbox is not bolded anymore.
