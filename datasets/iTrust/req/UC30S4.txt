An LHCP wishes to reply to a message. The LHCP views his or her message inbox. The LHCP opens the message to which he or she wishes to reply [S5], and then clicks the reply link above the message text. The LHCP enters the text of the response message (up to 1000 characters) he or she wishes to send, then clicks the send button. A row for showing the message subject (now preceded by RE:), the name of the recipient, and the timestamp are then visible in the LHCP's message outbox. A bolded row for showing the message subject (now preceded by RE:), the name of sender, and timestamp are then visible in the patient/representative's message inbox. A fake email is sent to the patient/representative alerting the patient/representative that a new message reply has arrived.
