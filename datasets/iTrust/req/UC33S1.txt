An HCP chooses to refer a patient to another receiving HCP through the referral feature on a patient's office visit page (UC11). The sending HCP must select a receiving HCP by either entering the HCP's MID and confirming the selection, or by searching for the HCP by name. The sending HCP is also presented with a text box to include notes about the referral. The sending HCP then chooses a priority from 1-3 (1 is most important, 3 is least important) for the referral. The HCP may send the referral, cancel the referral [E1], or edit the referral [E2]. Upon sending a referral, the patient, sending HCP, and receiving HCP receive a message summarizing the newly created referral information (sending HCP name & specialty, receiving HCP name & specialty, patient name, referral notes, and referral creation timestamp); additionally, the sending and receiving HCP messages include the referral priority.
