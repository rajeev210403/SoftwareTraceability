An HCP can reassign a previously created lab procedure to a different Lab Technician if the lab procedure is not yet in the testing state. The HCP selects a different Lab Technician from the list of available Lab Technicians (displayed with Lab Technician specialty and the number of pending lab procedures in his/her priority queue, grouped by priority). The HCP confirms the reassignment, or cancels the reassignment [E2].
