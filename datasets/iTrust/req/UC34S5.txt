A UAP can select to report physiologic measurements. He/she is presented with a list of the patients whose at least one physiologic data type is specified to be under monitoring and for whom he/she is allowed to report measurements. He or she can select a patient and then enter data. He or she can report the blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) [E2] and/or glucose levels [E3] for the patient. The input data, a timestamp, and the fact the the status was reported by case manager and their MID are saved. Only the applicable input entries (those whose corresponding data types of the patient are specified to be under monitoring) are displayed to the UAP.
